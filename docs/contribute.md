description: Help build PPSR Core

---


We welcome your contributions to PPSR Core. This site is maintained by a diverse group of voluntteers through the Citizen Science Assocation Data & Meta Data working group. This website serves as the canonical version. We keep track of our work within GitHub (no developer experience required). Proposed changes are made through GitHub pull requests and through the issue tracker. When our workgroup meets we review the pull requests to make decisions on inclusion within PSSR core.

**Thank you to all our contributors!**

## Contributing through GitHub

This standard is maintained in a GitHub repository. Don't worry, deep of GitHub is not required, **you don't have to be a programer**.

You will need to be logged into a free [GitHub](https://github.com/) account to make changes. We maintain a [technical page](technical) if you want to help with more the technical aspects or understand how this site was built.


### Editing pages


Editing any page is simple. At the bottom of each page is a "edit this page" link that will take you from the website to that file within within our repository GitHub. Pages are written in the [GitHub flavor of Markdown syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax). This is standard markdown with some additional features included by GitHub. [This quickstart](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) guide includes styling for headers, tables, URL linking, and font formating.

To submit your changes you will see input for "Commit changes".
- Include a [good description](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/). Explain **why** the change is needed.
- Add additional details if needed
- Submit a pull request

### Editing the Schema


Our schema and field definitions are maintained in this **google document**. That file is transformed into a JSON Schema which gets published to this website. Please make changes to that document directly.


### Reporting Issues


Minor issues & questions may be reported through the GitHub issue tracker. We use it to keep track of small tasks. For larger concerns, please join one of our meetings.
