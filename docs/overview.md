description: Overview of the PPSR Core standard

---
PPSR-Core is a set of global, transdisciplinary data and metadata standards describing contextualized details about PPSR projects (Project Data Model, or PDM), datasets (Dataset Data Model, or DDM), and data (Observation Data Model, or ODM). These standards are united, supported, and underlined by a common framework, the PPSR-Core common data model (CDM), which illustrates how information is structured within the citizen science domain (figure 1).

The PPSR-Core is not setting out to create a new data standard for the sake of creating a new standard. Instead it aims to unify a suite of existing data and metadata standards and ontologies into a standardized framework for application in the citizen science domain. In this respect it either uses the terms already applied in existing standards or provides attribute-level mappings between terms used in the PPSR-Core and equivalent terms used in other applicable standards (sometimes several). Where the PPSR context requires it or where there is no equivalent term available in other applicable standards, this standard will specify new attribute terms in the ppsr namespace.

## Rationale
Sharing information across databases maximizes everyone’s efforts, getting more “bang for the buck” out of information about citizen science projects everywhere. It leads to current, up-to-date, synchronized project lists and promotes a broader understanding of the global practice of citizen science.

The PPSR Core standard is comprised of the following set of artifacts:
## Common Data Model (CDM)
  - **CDM entity relationship diagram** - This graphically describes the relationships between the primary class entities in overall model. [current approved version: 2.0.0]
  - **CDM table of attributes** - This is a tabular representation of the CDM attributes and their definitions. [current approved version: 2.0.0]
