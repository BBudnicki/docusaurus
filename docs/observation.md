# Observational Data Models (ODM)
  - **Observational Data Models (ODM)** - This is still a work in progress and nothing has been published yet. However, it is intended to comprise a series of domain appropriate sets of attributes and/or schemas which are required for effective and useful aggregation of data for scientific use. An example of this would be the Darwin Core standard used for global biodiversity occurrence data. Other domains also have their specific standards. The ODM will recommend application of relevant existing domain standards where they exist, develop new models where they don't, and will seek to identify and standardize common attributes across domains to enable multi-disciplinary aggregation of datasets on those attributes for cross-disciplinary analysis.
