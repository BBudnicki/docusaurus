The standard comprises the following set of artefacts:
# Common Data Model (CDM)
  - **CDM entity relationship diagram** - This graphically describes the relationships between the primary class entities in overall model. [current approved version: 2.0.0]
  - **CDM table of attributes** - This is a tabular representation of the CDM attributes and their definitions. [current approved version: 2.0.0]
  
# Project Metadata Model (PMM)
  - **PMM entity relationship diagram** - This graphically describes the relationships between the class entities in the project metadata model. [current approved version: 2.0.0]
  - **PMM (Core Model) table of attributes** - This is a tabular representation of the PMM core model attributes and their definitions. [current approved version: 2.0.0]
  - **PMM (Extension Model) table of attributes** - This is a tabular representation of the PMM extension model attributes and their definitions. [current approved version: 2.0.0]
  - **PMM vocabularies** - These are controlled lists of defined terms for use in relevant vocabulary attributes in the PMM. These terms may be used either as provided in full or as a reduced subset relevant to the purpose for which they are being used. They should not be modified or augmented with additional terms as this would prevent sharability and effective aggregation. [current approved version: 2.0.0]
  
  
# Dataset Metadata Model (DMM)
  - **DMM entity relationship diagram** - This graphically describes the relationships between the class entities in the dataset metadata model. [current approved version: 2.0.0]
  - **DMM (Core Model) table of attributes** - This is a tabular representation of the DMM core model attributes and their definitions. [current approved version: 2.0.0]
  - **DMM (Extension Model) table of attributes** - This is a tabular representation of the DMM extension model attributes and their definitions. [current approved version: 2.0.0]
  - **Dataset Metadata Model vocabularies** -  [current approved version: 2.0.0]
  
# Observational Data Models (ODM)
  - **Observational Data Models (ODM)** - This is still a work in progress and nothing has been published yet. However, it is intended to comprise a series of domain appropriate sets of attributes and/or schemas which are required for effective and useful aggregation of data for scientific use. An example of this would be the Darwin Core standard used for global biodiversity occurrence data. Other domains also have their specific standards. The ODM will recommend application of relevant existing domain standards where they exist, develop new models where they don't, and will seek to identify and standardise common attributes across domains to enable multi-disciplinary aggregation of datasets on those attributes for cross-disciplinary analysis.
