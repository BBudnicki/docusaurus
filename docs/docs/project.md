# Project Metadata Model (PMM)
  - **PMM entity relationship diagram** - This graphically describes the relationships between the class entities in the project metadata model. [current approved version: 2.0.0]
  - **PMM (Core Model) table of attributes** - This is a tabular representation of the PMM core model attributes and their definitions. [current approved version: 2.0.0]
  - **PMM (Extension Model) table of attributes** - This is a tabular representation of the PMM extension model attributes and their definitions. [current approved version: 2.0.0]
  - **PMM vocabularies** - These are controlled lists of defined terms for use in relevant vocabulary attributes in the PMM. These terms may be used either as provided in full or as a reduced subset relevant to the purpose for which they are being used. They should not be modified or augmented with additional terms as this would prevent sharability and effective aggregation. [current approved version: 2.0.0]
