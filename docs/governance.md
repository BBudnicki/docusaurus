description: Governance of PPSR core
---
The CSA International Data and Metadata Working Group is the current custodian of the PPSR-Core models. In the future, as the **C**itizen **S**cience **G**lobal **P**artnership (**CSGP**) evolves, this decision might be revisited, especially considering the fourth foundational goal of the CSGP: to “support the collection and exchange of open and findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data by formalizing a citizen science data standard, creating a data directory, and building an open data portal.” We commit to an open and royalty-free model, i.e. the model shall remain open to access, re-use and extension/augmentation (new profiles).

A committee of the working group (the Model Governance Committee) has been established to manage the standardized models of the PPSR-Core. This committee is comprised of representatives from each of the established global citizen science associations who are typically interested and/or involved in IT or informatics as they relate to the citizen science domain. Management of the models includes the following functions:

- Maintaining the infrastructure used to curate and maintain the models themselves, as well as communicating the models and the managing framework throughout the global community. These include: the CSA PPSR-Core Github repository, the PPSR-Core Docusaurus web site; artefact archives; and working documents of the Committee.
- Maintaining and publishing the current accepted version of the PPSR-Core models and supporting information.
- Assessing and deciding on proposals to change the current accepted version of the models. 
- Defining the decision and action protocols for version release and dissemination of changes to the models or supporting information. 
- Ensuring that the current version and subsequent changes to the models are documented, published and promoted throughout the global citizen science communities.

If standardization bodies such as [ISO](https://www.iso.org), [OGC](https://www.ogc.org), [W3C](https://www.w3.org), [OBO foundry](http://www.obofoundry.org), or [BIS](https://www.tdwg.org) wish to endorse or build upon the models, then we will work with them and support their institutional processes where possible.

## How the published version gets updated
Anyone can lodge a submission for the Model Governance Committee to consider a change request (CR). All CRs submitted via the PPSR-Core Github repository issue tracker and pull requests will be considered by the Model Governance Committee and agreed CRs will be incorporated into a subsequent published version of the standard. See [contribute](/docs/contribute) for more details.
